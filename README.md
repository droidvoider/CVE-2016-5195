**DANGEROUS: This tool is issuing commands as an extremely privledged root + context**

This tool issues root commands on 64bit Android 6.01 dirtycow vulnerable devices. It
does so without verifying anything. It will write whatever you tell it to write without
even blinking!! My advice would be DON'T be a pioneer with my tools, ever!

This exploit gains root + install_recovery in one loop then root + system_server in the other.
Using a list of commands in a text file it will execute commands using those privledges.
It executes line by line in consecutive order and using identifiers it will execute the desired
command using one of the two available contexts.

If the exploit requires a file it needs to be copied to cache by another supporting process we
call bridge. bridge reads the same cmd_list.txt file to know what to copy, it ignores the
commands but instead reads the end copy commands.

We use two different methods to execute. The first method uses system() to execute the command.
If the system(command) fails we then process the command line for execv() and try again. In
some cases this is necessary, execv doesn't return and we currently do not test the status.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________


**BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:**
This tool uses a text file to determine what commands to issue along with which supporting files
to copy and where. I included an example cmd_list.txt used with an AT&T Note 5.
(root and at&t note 5 just went together in a sentence. im possible)

yes, there is an intentional error in cmd_list.txt to show the execv() attempt.
note: install_recovery context most powerful when calling .sh script in /system/bin/

1. create the following file ---> /data/local/tmp/cmd_list.txt
**Line Separators** All command lines will have these, or it will fail. **(spaces on command line only)**
**-$ == system_server** when first characters are -$ root+system_server will process this command
**-# == install_recovery** when first characters are -# root+install_recovery will process this command
**|**  <--- entire command including binary path ---> **|**
example system server command:
-$|pm disable com.ws.dm|
example install recovery command:
-#|/system/bin/mount -o rw,remount,rw /system|

2. place any supporting files into ---> /data/local/tmp/Superuser.apk
**Copy Line Separators** Copy lines must be at the end of "a" command line, inspecific.
**~** <--- source ---> **~** <--- destination ---> **~**
example system server WITH SUPPORTING FILES command
-$|/system/bin/pm install /cache/recovery/Superuser.apk|~/data/local/tmp/Superuser.apk~/cache/recovery/Superuser.apk~

3. By script or by hand. Place farm, till, toolbox, bridge, cmd_list.txt and any supporting files into
/data/local/tmp/

4. By script or by hand open an extra terminal for logging. adb logcat | grep -a droid_dd_dcow

5. adb shell /data/local/tmp/farm

6.  Add and remove a screen lock pin. Wait between add/remove then do it again. Sometimes it happens fast, sometimes slow
(it will fire eventually see your log terminal to know.. trust me, you will get plenty of messages)

**Makefile**
If you have the Android NDK setup on ubuntu open 2 terminals, make log, make run5 or make run6

**See Makefile for basic process of how things work.
**VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:**

**LIST OF COMMANDS**

## Showing the status
```bash
make log
```

## Running tool for Android 6.01 64 bit r1 branch
First, you must edit cmd_list.txt and carefully confirm the commands are correct and as desired!
```bash
make run6
```

## Running tool for Android 5.11 64 bit r2 branch
First, you must edit cmd_list.txt and carefully confirm the commands are correct and as desired!
```bash
make run5
```

## Notes
If the log gets stuck here
```
farm-root: [*] waiting for process to finish
```
try to get system-server to run a toolbox command. (turning lockscreen on and off seems to work for galaxy s7 active and galaxy Note 5).

Updated for Note5: Playing with power + vol. up + vol. down makes the script fire!!!
```
Screen dim: power to undim, swipe unlock (no pin), now: power + vol. up, power + vol. down and then power to dim.. Now: power + vol. up to undim, power to dim
(keep messing with the buttons, dim/undim and it fires easily) -- no need to mess with screenlock for me **Android 6.01 Oct 2016 security**

## Notes from original creator
freddierice on github original concept. I have reworked it a lot.
his todo list ---> "* fix for armeabi? doesn't seem to work for this architecture right now."
not a bad idea....

<LOCALTEST> --- currently removed I may put this back later if we are having issues.
**LOCAL TEST WILL EXECUTE ALL COMMANDS THRUGH FARM.C FROM DIRECTORY /DATA/LOCAL/TMP**
1. Edit Android.mk
2. Add -D LOCALTEST to LOCAL_MODULE := farm like this --> LOCAL_CFLAGS    += -fPIE -DDEBUG -D LOCALTEST
See example file I renamed --> LOCALTEST-Android.mk
open 2 terminals, make log, make run
