## WARNING: could hard brick your phone super easy this is the razors edge bud

## ur device rebuilds / on reboot? right??? <---- don't shrug and hammer out make run# (or do, whatevs)

## This exploit was written for a device which rebuilds the system on reboot.
## I do replace the binaries if the process goes well but if things don't go well I lose that ability
## If you're device doesn't rebuild system on reboot be cautious. If your binaries are too small it WILL SEG FAULT OUT
## Rebooting cures that for Samsung Note 5, Samsung S6, Samsung S7 Edge ... that's all i know, check yours
## never use this tool if you don't have firmware ready for your device, i reflash weekly at minimum doing this work!

## if you need help pm me on xda-developers.com I check it when I'm free as my hobby is Android and that's my resource
