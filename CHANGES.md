###Changes & Bug fixes 03 May 2017
Removed system_server() loop entirely
All commands processed by install_recovery
First -# and -$ doesn't matter now actually, can start with | also, maybe, hmm
setcon and setexeccon are now set before executing
system() call completely removed in favor of execvp
technically path isn't necessary for binaries in the environmenal path now, either way is fine
exit codes should be much more readable.
I have yet to be denied anything with the new code, i can cause an error of course.. but as of yet this code seems omnipotent

``
I added assayyed cmd_list.txt and Makefile. To use these you need to use your AP file from your firmware with Assayyed Kitchen
Go through the steps to build a custom rom, and place the boot.img from your AP firmware file into the work folder. or whatever
see the instructions.. unpack your boot.img, root it, then just copy the files in the work folder, or whatever, to a directory
I called it PJ1_ASSAYED_KITCHEN, for example. Repack the image and in the folder now will be boot.img again.
it's not hard but you have to try a couple times to learn your way there....
``

**what's up doc, right?**
I am very confident I am replacing all files on the phone now, to my own surprise the way I execute allowed me to read any file.
What's next is getting the phone to reload, not so easy maybe. Time to tinker with the memory

###Bug fixes 28 April 2017
```
-Execution errors were always attributed to Sys. Server context. It now correctly reports which context had a failure.
-install_recovery time_to_wait has been removed as it is simply unneeded. the code works correctly.
-execv commands are now split 2 parts <binary path> and <arguments> .. parsing beyond this hasn't proven necessary
-Code size reducing strategies employed. We need room for a possible final solution ;)
-Many LOGV("successfully"); messages have been commented out. We only report error for these tasks as that's really all that's important.
-logcat tag made to be unique to this exploit. it is now 'GRP_Root_Kit' in logcat, (it was droid_dd_dcow taken from my other exploit tool)
```

####Notice of impending change
```
* The tool will use more contexts in the near future
-I am restructuring toolbox.c exploit to loop a new process for each context versus hard coding two contexts.
-system_server_loop will become context_looper, or something close to that.
-system() calls or execvp() call will either be selectable or auto-selected along with these changes.

```
