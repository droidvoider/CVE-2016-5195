###Bug fixes 28 April 2017
```
-Execution errors were always attributed to Sys. Server context. It now correctly reports which context had a failure.
-install_recovery time_to_wait has been removed as it is simply unneeded. the code works correctly.
-execv commands are now split 2 parts <binary path> and <arguments> .. parsing beyond this hasn't proven necessary
-Code size reducing strategies employed. We need room for a possible final solution ;)
-Many LOGV("successfully"); messages have been commented out. We only report error for these tasks as that's really all that's important.
-logcat tag made to be unique to this exploit. it is now 'GRP_Root_Kit' in logcat, (it was droid_dd_dcow taken from my other exploit tool)
```

####Notice of impending change
```
* The tool will use more contexts in the near future
-I am restructuring toolbox.c exploit to loop a new process for each context versus hard coding two contexts.
-system_server_loop will become context_looper, or something close to that.
-system() calls or execvp() call will either be selectable or auto-selected along with these changes.

```
